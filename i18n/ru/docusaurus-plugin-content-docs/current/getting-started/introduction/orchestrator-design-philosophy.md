# Orchestrator's design philosophy

Now that you've gotten your feet wet, let's talk about Orchestrator's design.

:::important
Every visual scripting engine is different and fits different needs.
:::

Not only do various visual scripting systems offer a range of features, how those features are designed and interact with the underlying game engine is also unique.
Orchestrator attempts to take some of the best practices and concepts from other visual scripting engines, and incorporates those into a plug-in that works well for Godot.

## All-inclusive

Orchestrator aims to provide answers to most questions.
We want game developers to be able to use full, visual tools to build game logic rather than having to rely on traditional text-based scripts.

We acknowledge that visual scripting is not for everyone, and we expect that respect to be reciprocated.
It's equally important to understand that there are those who simply struggle to learn text-based languages, and can thrive using visual tools.

Our mission and prime directive is to provide state-of-the-art tooling, and let you decide if it fits your needs.

Games do not have to be made solely with or without one scripting technology like Orchestrator.
You can safely mix-n-match, using Orchestrator for certain game aspects and combine GDScript or C# for others.

## Open source

Orchestrator is a fully, open-source code base under the **Apache License 2.0**.
Anyone can freely use Orchestrator in any type of project, public, commercial, and proprietary as long as you comply with the license requirements.

See the [Complying with licenses](../../about/complying-with-licenses) section for details.

## Community-driven

**Orchestrator is made by its community, for the community, and for all game creators**.
The needs of users and open discussions are what drive the core updates we make to the plug-in.
New features from the core developers often focus on what will benefit most users first, and foremost.
