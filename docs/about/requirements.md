# System requirements

This page outlines the system requirements for the Orchestrator plug-in.
These specifications are given for informative purposes only, but they can be referred to if you're looking to build or upgrade a system to use develop games using Orchestrator.

## Orchestrator

Orchestrator is a plug-in that runs inside the Godot Editor during development.
Therefore, the use of the plug-in depends solely on meeting the requirements to run the Godot Editor.

The current **minimum** specifications required to run the Godot Editor are available in the <ExternalLink href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/about/system_requirements.html#godot-editor">Godot documentation</ExternalLink>.

## Exported Orchestrator project

Similarly, to use Orchestrator in an exported Godot game, the plug-in must run inside the Godot engine.
Therefore, the use of the plug-in depends solely on meeting the requirements to run the Godot engine.

The current **minimum** specifications required to run an exported Godot project are available in the <ExternalLink href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/about/system_requirements.html#exported-godot-project">Godot documentation</ExternalLink>.
