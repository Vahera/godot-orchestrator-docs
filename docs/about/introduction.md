# Introduction

Welcome to the official documentation of **Orchestrator**, the ultimate Visual-Scripting plug-in for Godot.
Orchestrator is a powerful, yet user-friendly plug-in that you can use to develop any type of game.

This page gives a broad overview of the plug-in and this documentation, so you know where to start if you are a beginner or where to look should you need more specific information on a feature.

## Before you start

The [Tutorials and resources](../community/tutorials-and-resources) page has a list of video tutorials contributed by various authors, including the authors of the plug-in.
If you prefer video to text, consider checking them out.
Otherwise, [Getting Started](../getting-started/introduction) is a great starting point.

In case you have trouble with one of the tutorials or your project, you can always find help through the Vahera Studios Discord community, our Forums, or the Godot Discord.

## About Orchestrator

Every game emerges from a single idea, and the creation of a game involves many moving parts.
Orchestrator's goal is to provide a series of easy to use, highly customizable features to create game logic, interactions, and supporting logic using visual scripting rather than traditional text-based code.

Orchestrator is completely free and open source under the <ExternalLink href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache License, Version 2.0</ExternalLink>.
The game you create is yours, down to the last line of code.
This plug-in's development is fully independent and entirely community-driven, giving the community the ability to shape the plug-in's future for their needs and expectations.

## Organization of the documentation

This documentation is organized into several sections:

* **About** contains this introduction, as well as information about the plug-in, its history, licensing, authors, and more.
It also contains the [Frequently asked questions](../about/faq) section, helping answer some of the most common questions.

* **Getting Started** contains all necessary information on using the plug-in to make games.
It starts with a **Step by Step** tutorial which should be the entry point for all new users.
**This is the best place to start if you're new**!

* The **Manual** can be read or referenced as needed, in any order.
It contains feature-specific tutorials and documentation.

* **Contributing** provides information related to contributing back to Orchestrator, whether to the plug-in's code, documentation, examples, or other aspects.
It describes how to report bugs, how contributor workflows are organized, and more.
It also has sections intended for advanced users and contributors, with information on compiling the plug-in.

* **Community** is dedicated to the life of the Orchestrator plug-in's community.
It refers to various community outlets and discords, and contains a list of recommended tutorials and materials beyond this documentation.

* The **Script Node Reference** documents each Orchestrator visual script node type, how you can use them, their purpose, and how to configure them.
This is where you should check if you don't understand a specific node or are unsure how to locate a specific node or feature.
