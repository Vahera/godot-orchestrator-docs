# Learning new features

Orchestrator a tremendously feature-rich plug-in, directly driven by Godot's extensive library of features.
There is most certainly a lot to learn.
This page explains how you can use the online documentation, built-in code reference, and other tools to learn new features and techniques.

## Making the most of the manual

What you are reading now is called the user manual.
It documents the plug-in's concepts and features.
When learning a new topic, you can start by browsing the corresponding section of this website.
The left menu allows you to explore broad topics, while the right menu provides more targeted topics within the current page.

The user manual has a companion [Script Node Reference](../../nodes/all_nodes) that explains each Orchestrator script node, their properties, how to use them, and their purpose.
While the manual covers general features, concepts, and how to use the plug-in, the reference is focused on using the Orchestrator Node API.

:::tip
At this time, the [Script Node Reference](../../nodes/all_nodes) is only available online.

## Thinking like a programmer

Teaching programming foundations and how to think like a game designer is beyond the scope of this documentation.
If you are new to programming, we recommend this free online course to get started:

- Harvard University offers free courses to learn to program, <ExternalLink href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/">CS50</ExternalLink>.
It teaches programming fundamentals and how to think like a programmer.
Even when using visual tools, having this basic knowledge can easily improve your efficiency at making games.

## Learn with the community

Orchestrator has a growing community of users.
If you are stuck on a program or need help to understand how to achieve something, you can ask other users for help in our <ExternalLink href="https://discord.gg/J3UWtzWSkT">Discord</ExternalLink>.

The best place to ask questions and find already answered ones is on our official discord.

## Tutorials and examples

This manual aims to provide a comprehensive reference to Orchestrator's features.
Aside from the 2D and 3D getting started series, it does not contain tutorials to implement specific game genres or features.
If you are looking for a tutorial about creating a role-playing game, platformer, or other, please see our [Tutorials and resources](../../community/tutorials-and-resources), which lists examples and content made not only by the plug-in authors, but the Orchestrator community.
